    "en": "<p>While the hotels do not provide courtesy transportation, there are plenty of options to get into Manhattan. Based on your group, we invite you to find the best option for you all. You could use the company Super Shuttle from the airport, which costs approximately $25-$40 per person and drops you off right at your destination. No reservations are required from the airport to your destination, but they are required for your return trip. You can find more information on them here: https://www.supershuttle.com/locations/ Also, you can visit these links for other companies to arrange shuttle service at your own convenience: www.goairportshuttle.com, www.stateshuttle.com, www.nycairporter.com</p>"
