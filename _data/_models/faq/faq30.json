    "en": "<p>New York City delivers excitement, culture and fun during its four distinct seasons, each with different activities to explore. Overall, the best time to visit New York City is from April through June and September to early November when the weather is mild and pleasant but the tourist crowds are not overwhelming. Fall in NYC - and especially Central Park - is breathtaking as the leaves change color. Spring offers everything in full blossom and is a perfect time of year for sightseeing. Winter brings holiday shopping, sparkling store windows and the massive Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center.</p>"
