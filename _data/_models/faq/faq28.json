    "en": "<p>Guests of Apple Core Hotels enjoy reduced rate parking at off-site garages near each hotel. In order to receive a reduced rate, you must park at the designated garage, then present your ticket from the garage to the Front Desk, who will then validate it. This ensures that you get the reduced rate upon leaving the garage. Please check each individual hotel's page for more information about the specific garages that offer our discount. Please note: Parking space and pricing is subject to change and is based on availability by the operator.</p>"
