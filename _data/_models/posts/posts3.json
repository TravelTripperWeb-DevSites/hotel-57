Filled with boutiques, fabulous restaurants, and entertaining street performances, South Beach&rsquo;s world-famous promenade has something for everyone. Here&rsquo;s your guide to Lincoln Road&rsquo;s storied history and multitude of options for places to grab a bite to eat and indulge in a little retail therapy.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">The History of Lincoln Road</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lincoln Road was one of the first developed areas in all of South Beach. The social center became the heart of the island, featuring offices and premium retail destinations like Bonwit Teller, Saks Fifth Avenue, Cadillac, and Packard car dealerships. After a 1950s redesign, Lincoln Road (named after the 16th president) was elevated with gardens, fountains, and an amphitheater. As visitors continued to flock to the happening street, traffic eventually shut down and Lincoln Road became one of the nation&rsquo;s first pedestrian malls.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Today, Lincoln Road continues to evolve. The high-end stores have all but moved out to make room for independent shops, galleries, and eateries. You&rsquo;ll still find national retail stores among the 200 boutiques, but the artistic hub is now experiencing an indie resurgence.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1561549829134\" class=\" \" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1561547889/yteivy9baoztzxy4xumm.jpg\" alt=\"friends-enjoy-ice-cream-outside-on-lincoln-road\" data-image-large=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1561547889/yteivy9baoztzxy4xumm.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_992,w_992/v1561547889/yteivy9baoztzxy4xumm.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_768,w_768/v1561547889/yteivy9baoztzxy4xumm.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_300,w_300/v1561547889/yteivy9baoztzxy4xumm.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,h_140,w_140/v1561547889/yteivy9baoztzxy4xumm.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Where to Eat and Drink</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Locals are buzzing about the new Lincoln Eatery.
