Join us with your special sweetheart for an evening of tapas, Champagne, music, and an unforgettable Art Talk as we toast to the most romantic night of the year.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.sagamoresouthbeach.com/sagamore-is-art/art-advisor-sebastien-laboureau/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">S&eacute;bastien Laboureau</a> and Bertrand Scholler lead the Art Talk with a discussion on all things &lsquo;love&rsquo; - the love of art, the art of love, and the transformative power one has on the other, and ourselves. Like Robert Indiana&rsquo;s iconic <em>Love</em> sculpture that has been reproduced in displays around the world, the panel will discuss other renowned works of love before an in-depth artist conversation.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Laboureau and Scholler are joined by featured artist AlexyP, who brings his &lsquo;Place2Kiss&rsquo; concept to the Sagamore grounds. A highly regarded landscape and portrait photographer, AlexyP&rsquo;s works have been published in esteemed art magazines around the world. He relocated to the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami after leaving Paris in 2005 and brought a whole lot of love to Miami&rsquo;s art scene with his <a href=\"https://place2kiss.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&lsquo;Place2Kiss&rsquo;</a> movement. It&rsquo;s simple - &nbsp;AlexyP stencils the words &lsquo;Place2Kiss&rsquo; on sidewalks around the world. The places dedicated to love are sealed with a kiss from passers-by, because the only way to fight the bad &ldquo;is to take the time to love&rdquo;.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1561620666575\" class=\" \" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1561547848/v38pm2jxjy3ayjwjilgn.jpg\" alt=\"place2kiss-logo\" data-image-large=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1561547848/v38pm2jxjy3ayjwjilgn.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_992,w_992/v1561547848/v38pm2jxjy3ayjwjilgn.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_768,w_768/v1561547848/v38pm2jxjy3ayjwjilgn.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_300,w_300/v1561547848/v38pm2jxjy3ayjwjilgn.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,h_140,w_140/v1561547848/v38pm2jxjy3ayjwjilgn.jpg\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Become a part of AlexyP&rsquo;s traveling cooperative movement of love by snapping a picture of you and your Valentine at one of the &lsquo;Place2Kiss&rsquo; locations he tags around Sagamore.
