Show your appreciation for the important woman in your life with prosecco-filled brunches, South Beach&rsquo;s best shopping streets, and top local restaurants. Read on for ways to let Mom know how much you care this Mother&rsquo;s Day, May 12th, with a trip to Miami Beach.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Brunch</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Start the morning by taking mom to a decadent, but well-deserved brunch. Yardbird on Lennox Avenue serves up their famous Chicken n&rsquo; Watermelon n&rsquo; Waffles and the most delicious fried green tomato BLT. For a bottomless brunch, visit Prime Fish for gorgeous ocean views and an over-the-top buffet including carving stations, desserts, mimosas, and bloody marys. One of our favorite night spots is also one of our favorite places to visit on weekend afternoons. Sweet Liberty brunches until 5 p.m. on weekends and features a &lsquo;Pimp Your Prosecco&rsquo; selection of bubbly brunch cocktails mixed with fresh fruits, fluffy juices, oils, and herbs.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><a href=\"https://www.sagamoresouthbeach.com/blog/5-south-beach-cocktail-bars-to-try/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5 Cocktail Bars to try in South Beach</a></em></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Browse SoBe&rsquo;s Shopping Streets</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Al fresco shopping is a must while in South Beach. Places like Lincoln Road, Collins Avenue, Washington Avenue, Ocean Drive, Sunset Harbour, and Espa&ntilde;ola Way are busy pedestrian malls with tons of street entertainment, caf&eacute;s, and a large concentration of shops. For locally-owned boutiques indicative to SoBe, stick to Sunset Harbour. If you or mom have an eye for architecture, check out the Art Deco facade of Ocean Drive or the Spanish colonial buildings along Espa&ntilde;ola Way for colorful photo ops on your shopping spree.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Chill out on the Beach</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you book your SoBe stay with Sagamore, you are getting direct access to the Atlantic Ocean through our backyard. Unwind and enjoy a true beachfront hotel in the heart of Miami Beach. Book our <a href=\"https://www.sagamoresouthbeach.com/offers/cocktails-waves-and-umbrellas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cocktails Waves and Umbrellas</a> package for a daily food and drink credit, and complimentary lounge chairs and umbrellas for you and mom to soak up the sun.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><a href=\"https://www.sagamoresouthbeach.com/blog/spend-the-day-poolside-with-sagamore/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spend the Day Poolside with Sagamore Hotel</a></em></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Dine at Miami Beach&rsquo;s Best Restaurants</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We&rsquo;ve rounded up a few of the highest-rated restaurants in Miami Beach that we think will make mom feel relaxed, satisfied, and catered to on her special day. Pane &amp; Vino is a Miami favorite, serving up &ldquo;Italian heaven&rdquo; from their cozy neighborhood eatery with housemade pasta, gnocchi, and an impressive wine menu with imports straight from Italy. CVI.CHE specializes in Peruvian style bites with a ceviche menu that is out of this world. Visit their Lincoln Road location for a laid back space. For an extra casual night out, try La Ventana Colombian Restaurant on Washington Avenue. The small spot has limited seating capabilities, so reservations are recommended. Order a margarita in a sugar skull mug and try the rich and cheesy empanadas to start. Choose from a list of traditional Colombian entrees like the protein-rich Bandeja Paisa or the Mojarra. Save room for dessert and surprise mom with their sweet and fluffy passion fruit mousse.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Stay with Sagamore Hotel</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you book your South Beach stay with Sagamore Hotel, enjoy exclusive access to our curated contemporary art exhibitions, lush outdoor oasis, and pool overlooking the Atlantic.
