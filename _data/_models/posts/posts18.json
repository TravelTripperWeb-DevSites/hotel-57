Let us help you navigate this exciting weekend.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Art Through a Contemporary Lens</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Established in February of 2012, the President&rsquo;s Day weekend event presents emerging contemporary talent, mid-career artists, and blue chip post-war modern masters from nearly 180 artists and 60 international galleries. Contemporary masters like Banksy, Andy Warhol, and Jean-Michel Basquiat have all been exhibited at Art Wynwood amid a weekend of fabulous brunches, cocktail receptions, and the Tony Goldman Lifetime Artistic Achievement Award Dinner honoring one trailblazing contemporary artist.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Art Wynwood is a family affair. The ArtRageous Kids Center organized by the Miami Children&rsquo;s Museum provides hands-on interactive art discovery projects for children aged 4-12 years. While you browse the floor, children can immerse themselves in visual art forms and try their hand at ceramics, painting, sculpting, and printmaking.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Your VIP Key to the Cultural Epicenter of Miami</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For an elevated experience, become an Art Wynwood VIP for exclusive access to an opening reception, unlimited entry, admission to the VIP Lounge, general admission to the Miami Yacht Show, and admittance to partnering museums during the fair days.
